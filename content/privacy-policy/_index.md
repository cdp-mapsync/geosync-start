At GeoSync, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains the type of information that is collected and recorded by GeoSync and how we use it.

#### INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

**Account** - GeoSync collects information in order to set up customer accounts. In most cases this will be a name and email address.

**Services** - GeoSync Services are designed to make it simple for you to store your map data, collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit your data — like files, messages, comments, and photos — as well as information related to it. In addition, our applications may perform tasks like accessing your camera in order for you to take and store photos on our service.

#### LOG FILES

GeoSync follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services’ analytics. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.

#### COOKIES

Like any other website, GeoSync uses ‘cookies’. These cookies are used to store information including visitors’ preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the users’ experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors’ browser type and/or other information.

#### PRIVACY POLICIES

We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other third parties.

**Support Staff** - GeoSync staff may access your data to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.

**Other Users** - In some situations, sending and sharing data with other users may be accompanied by your name and email.

**Account Administrators** - Your account administrator may have the ability to access and control your account. Please refer to your organization's internal policies if you have questions about this.

**Law & Order** - We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of GeoSync or our users; or (d) protect GeoSync's property rights.

#### DO NOT TRACK

GeoSync does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.

#### CONSENT

By using our website or applications, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its Terms and Conditions.
