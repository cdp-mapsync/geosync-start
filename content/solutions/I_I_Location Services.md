### I&I Locating Services using the iTrackerÂ®
iTracking is the latest in I&I locating technology. Deployed as a network of sensors, iTrackers can monitor hundreds of manholes simultaneously and detect any change to flow caused by infiltration or inflow. After only 1-2 weather events, you can know exactly where your I&I at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.
