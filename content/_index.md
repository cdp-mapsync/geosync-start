  content: Technology comes with obstacles. Most often these obstacles are cleared
    by a generic, one-size-fits-all application or an expensive mega-solution. We
    create software tailored to our customers. We do not aim for mass-adoption or
    shareholder profits. We refer to it as everyday software for everyday work made
    for everyday people.
- title: It all starts with a project
  images:
  - images/feature-1.png
  content: A project encapsulates all the data related to a certain area or category.
    This grouping connects all the maps, point clouds, data tables and media together
    to create a complete view of your assets. Users can easily jump between sections
    to find what they need or add extra information.
- title: Maps add the visual connection
  images:
  - images/feature-2.png
  content: GeoSync is defined by its spatial capabilities and the backbone of our
    platform is mapping. Complex information is simplified by having an approachable
    map. A map in our system can link to other maps creating a hierarchy that allows
    anyone to quickly navigate large datasets.
- title: Point clouds create depth
  images:
  - images/feature-3.png
  content: Any location can lead to more data. Traversing across maps can lead to
    an incredible breadth of information, but there is also value in digging deeper
    into a single location. Point clouds let you explore locations and find related
    data in an immersive setting. This scale allows you to measure something as small
    as an object in a room.
